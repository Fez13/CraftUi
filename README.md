# CraftUI
CraftUI is my new iteration of a Vulkan engine. This time, I will be focusing on building UIs, but it will be flexible enough to work with 3D and maybe ray queries.
The most important part of this project will be the Vulkan abstraction, which will be made with lots of functionality in order to be useful for other projects.
